#Dataset Description
The data was collected from 4 subjects(2 male and 2 female subjects) for 8 hours. This activities are classified into 5 classes:
1- Sitting, 2- Standing, 3- Walking, 4- Standing-up and 5- Sitting-down. The data was colllected using wearable accelerometer mounted on 
their right arm, left thigh, waist and right ankle wach giving reading along the X-axis,Y-axis and Z-axis. The dataset consists of 
165,633 samples.

Attributes of the data:
1- Name
2- Gender
3- Age
4- Height(in meter)
5- Weight
6- BMI(Body Mass Index)
7- x1 (accelerometer 1's reading along X-axis)
8- y1 (accelerometer 1's reading along Y-axis)
9- z1 (accelerometer 1's reading along Z-axis)
10- x2 (accelerometer 2's reading along X-axis)
11- y2 (accelerometer 2's reading along Y-axis)
12- z2 (accelerometer 2's reading along Z-axis)
13- x3 (accelerometer 3's reading along X-axis)
14- y3 (accelerometer 3's reading along Y-axis)
15- z3 (accelerometer 3's reading along Z-axis)

Twelve more features (Norm, Pitch and Roll) were manually calculated for each accelerometer with 1 second time window with
150ms overlapping.
